#C algorithms
Algorithms in c  that I have used for teaching and self learning over the years. Use at your own risk. As a general tip dont use algorithms that you don't understand. Also just because an algorithm is here that doesn't mean it should be your solution as there are often better algorithms and this repo is just demos.

-Live long and prosper.
